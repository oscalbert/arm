Projects around ARM technology

Programming arm processor is really an interesting activity.

However, as there are many different build tools, librairies, SoC types and boards, starting a new project from scratch
can be frustrating.

Here you will find some projects for different boards that use:
- the GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm;
- libopencm3;
- and FreeRTOs.


The GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm can be downloaded here:

The libopencm3 can be downloaded here:

The FreeRTOS can be downloaded here:

I hope it can help !
