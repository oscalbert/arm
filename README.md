## Projects around ARM technology

Programming ARM microcontroller is really an interesting activity.

However, as there are many different build tools, librairies, SoC types and boards, starting a new project from scratch
can be frustrating.

Here you will find some projects for different boards that use:
- the GNU Embedded Toolchain for ARM;
- libopencm3;
- and FreeRTOS.


The GNU Embedded Toolchain for ARM can be downloaded here:

The libopencm3 can be downloaded here:
[https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3)

The FreeRTOS can be downloaded here:
[https://www.freertos.org/](https://www.freertos.org/)


I hope it can help !
